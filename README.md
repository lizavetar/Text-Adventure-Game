# Text-Adventure-Game
My first experience with Python.
As a part of Data Science: Python course I created an interactive text adventure game based on time travelling. One of the grading rubric was humor, so this is actually quite funny.

I was creating this after 2 weeks into coding (with absolutely zero previous experience) and it can be used as an example for my high learning speed.

Enjoy!
